Currently the app demonstrates these things:
- Drops a deck of cards onto table instantiated from an AssetBundle.
- Allows you to shuffle the deck of cards.
- Allows you to draw a card.
- Allows you to see the last 5 drawn cards.
- All used cards are restacked.
- Cards can be reshuffled and reset at any time.

- Currently only tested to be building and running properly for OSX Desktop x86.
